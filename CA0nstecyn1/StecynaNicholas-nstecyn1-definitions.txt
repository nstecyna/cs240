find
The find command searches a directory for a specified file. It will use the current directory automatically, if another one is not specified. The command searches by using the rules of precedence.

pwd
The pwd command prints out the name of the current working directory. The command will not look for symlinks unless specified by the -L flag.

mkdir
The mkdir command will make a directory or directories, if they do not already exist in the current working directory.

more
The make command uses a makefile to maintain groups of programs. Every time the make command is called, it will determine which pieces of a program specified in the makefile need to be recompiled, and recompiles them.

mv
The mv command either renames a file or moves it into a specified directory.
