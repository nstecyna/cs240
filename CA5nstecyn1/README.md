Flight Discovery System (FDS)

To run the program, first make it by typing 'make'.
Then type ./FDS with the name of the input file containing the Daily Direct Flight Schedule (list of flights).

The program will ask for user input for the name of the departure city (Case sensative), the arrival city, and the earliest departure time that the user is willing to use.
The program will then ask for the itinerary method you want to use (Any Itinerary = "any" / Earliest Arrival = "earliest")

After the first itinerary is made, the program will ask for the earliest departure time again.
The program ends after this, and must be run again the same way as earlier.

Thank you!
